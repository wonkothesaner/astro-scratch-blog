			<b>TL;DR</b>...I used to work long hours implementing Enterprise IT software
			solutions. </br> Now I am happier trying to write my own code. In fact,
			I'm happier as long as I am at home, with family and friends, and
			learning.

		For those willing to read on further I am
		<b><i>Curious. Impatient. Perpetually</i></b> - that is what I have on my WhatsApp
		profile. Hey, Mark Z here's looking at you!
	</p>
	<p>
		Writing about me is almost certainly the last thing that I would choose
		to do. So please forgive the brevity.
	</p>
	<p>
		I was born in London before they landed on the moon. Not that they
		landed on the moon in London; I hope you know what I meant?
	</p>
	If I had a dinner party with 5 people (alive or dead), I would invite Buzz Aldrin
	for sure. üåù Neil Armstrong might kill the atmosphere, sorry Neil. I will leave
	the other four invitees for a later blog post.
	<p>
		I grew up south of London. Where exactly? That is not as important as
		all the chances that I was given by my parents. To do and explore as I
		wanted to. Within some boundaries, yes, but at least they were clear.
	</p>

	<p>
		Philip Larkin wrote a poem about parents (<a
			href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/48419/this-be-the-verse"
			target="_blank"
			rel="noopener noreferrer">This Be The Verse</a
		>) that may resonate with you. I can relate to some (but not all) of it;
		most especially because I now have children myself.
	</p>
	<p>
		Once I left home, I went to university. Which one? That is a fair
		question and indeed may be of interest to some (and of import to what
		follows) but <i>I find it often brings too much baggage to the table</i
		>. Perhaps this is a generational thing although I am not sure I
		understand the generational things.
	</p>

	<p>
		I did Engineering but was not that good at it. I left not knowing what I
		wanted to do so applied to some investment banks. Because some of my
		friends had done the same and the money appeared good.
	</p>
	<MediaObject image={golfImage} alt="My Profile" flip={false}>
		I played golf while waiting for the banks to respond. It did not take
		them long. And then I played a while longer. I did not get a single
		interview, let alone job offer. I guess they knew my heart was not in
		it?
