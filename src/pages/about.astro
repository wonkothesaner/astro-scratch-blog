			<b>TL;DR</b>...I used to work long hours doing things with other
			people's software. I made a good living.
		</p><p>
			I have stopped that now and am trying, among other things, to write
			my own code. I am happiest at home, when learning with family and
			friends.

	<p>
		For those of you reading on past TL;DR (see <a href="/glossary"
			>here for a definition of sorts</a
		>) further I am
		<b><i>curious, impatient, perpetually.</i></b>
		At least that is what it says on my WhatsApp profile, which is the only Meta
		product I use.
	</p>
	<p>
		Writing about me is almost certainly the last thing that I would choose
		to do. So please forgive the brevity.

			I was born in London before they landed on the moon. Not that they
			landed on the moon in London; I hope you know what I meant? If I had
			a dinner party with 5 people (alive or dead), I would invite Buzz
			Aldrin for sure. üåù Neil Armstrong might kill the atmosphere, sorry
			Neil. I will leave the other four invitees for a later blog post.

	I grew up south of London. Where exactly? That is not as important as all the
	chances that I was given by my parents. To do and explore as I wanted to. Within
	some boundaries, yes, but at least they were clear.

	<p>
		Philip Larkin wrote a poem about parents (<a
			href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/48419/this-be-the-verse"
			target="_blank"
			rel="noopener noreferrer">This Be The Verse</a
		>) that may resonate with you. I can relate to some (but not all) of it;
		most especially because I now have children myself.
	</p>
	<p>
		Once I left home, I went to university. Which one? That is a fair
		question and indeed may be of interest to some (and of import to what
		follows) but <i>I find it often brings too much baggage to the table</i
		>. Perhaps this is a generational thing although I am not sure I
		understand the generational things.
	</p>

	<p>
		I did Engineering but was not that good at it. I left not knowing what I
		wanted to do so applied to some investment banks. Because some of my
		friends had done the same and the money appeared good.
	</p>
	<MediaObject image={golfImage} alt="My Profile" flip={false}>
		<p>
			I played golf while waiting for the banks to respond. It did not
			take them long. And then I played a while longer. I did not get a
			single interview, let alone job offer. I guess they knew my heart
			was not in it?
