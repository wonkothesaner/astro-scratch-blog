			<b>TL;DR</b>...I used to work stupid long hours doing things with

			<b>wanted</b> to write a website like this one.

		I am no longer paid. I am trying, among other things, to write my own
		code and explain what I learn along the way. There is already a wealth
		of courses and content out there. All of which is written and presented
		by many people much more qualified than I. So any content here should be
		taken as the "Musings of the Sane". Where Sane here is a reference to
		John Watson, otherwise known as Wonko the Sane. See <a

		I am happiest at home, when working, talking and learning with family
		and friends. I am
		<b><i>curious, impatient, perpetually.</i></b>
		At least that is what it says on my WhatsApp profile, which is the only Meta
		product I use.

			I was born in London before they landed on the moon. Not that they
			landed on the moon in London; you know what I meant I hope? If I had
			a dinner party with 5 people (alive or dead), I would invite Buzz
			Aldrin for sure. üåù Neil Armstrong might kill the atmosphere, sorry
			Neil. I will leave the other four invitees for a later blog post.

		Philip Larkin wrote a poem about parents which I believe he titled <a
			href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/48419/this-be-the-verse"
			target="_blank"
			rel="noopener noreferrer">This Be The Verse</a
		>). It may resonate with you. I can relate to some (but not all) of it;
		most especially because I now have children myself.
	</p>
	<p>
		I grew up south of London. Where exactly? That is not as important as
		all the chances that I was given by my parents. Chances to do and
		explore pretty much as I wanted to. Within boundaries, yes, but at least
		those boundaries were clear (it was easier back then). One day, Dad
		brought a Commodore Pet back and I remember playing Space Invaders and a
		game, whose name I cannot remember, where you fought naval battles.
		Either way, I enjoyed myself and eventually moved up to a BBC Micro and
		Elite in the 80s. If you want to know what a Commodore Pet is then look
		at the top of this page for a picture of its keyboard and <a

		> for an example.
	</p>
	<p>
		Once I left home, I went to university and did some Engineering, while
		being sponsored by Jaguar Motor Cards (back when they were owned by the
		UK Government and not Ford or Tata or whomever). I was not particularly
		good at it. And I left University not knowing what I wanted to do.

			I played golf while working out the next step to take. And then a
			lady asked for an egg and cress sandwich (I was working in the golf
			club bar) and mentioned her husband had a job going. I went along
			for the interview and started working for living.

	<MediaObject image={mondeoImage} alt="Ford Mondeo" flip={true}>
		<p>
			I worked for a company that made the front seats for the Ford
			Mondeo. And, within a year, found myself working in Belgium with a
			wonderful lady called Karin, who quickly became the love of my life.
			We set off around the world on a series of adventures.

			We lived in the UK and then moved to east coast (Boston) and west
			coast of the US. Before then moving on to Singapore, Australia
			before returning to London in the UK. We typically never lived in
			one place more than two years. Until we got to London in 2006, where
			we stuck. Two children arrived in 2010 and 2012 before Brexit
			happened in 2016.

		Which brings us to the current chapter in our lives together. As a
		result of many things, we moved back to live in Belgium at the beginning
		of 2021. It is here, in place called Hasselt Limburg, that I write these
		words and say thank you for reading this far.
